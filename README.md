A fractal generator running on GPU.

Currently supports the Julia fractal, as seen rendered below:

Planned improvements:
- Increasing render times through more clever allocation of GPU power
- Add support for an abstracted fractal class, allowing for the generation of many different kinds of fractals
- Allow support to generate differing aspect ratios, and add the ability to change axis-scale
